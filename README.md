# Dolphins

This repository contains the contents for Kyra Bankhead's thesis project 'The diffusion dynamics of human-induced food provisioning on Sarasota dolphins'

## Description

By developing a set of models based on the network-based diffusion analysis framework to the +50 years of individualized foraging and social association data, we aim to quantify how much, if any, of the diffusion of 'begging' behavior is due to individual dolphins learning it by themselves (individual learning), and how much is due to individuals socially learning from their peers, mothers, or other relatives.
