# Dolphins

The diffusion dynamics of human-induced food provisioning on Sarasota dolphins

# Description

Here, we propose to track the spread of this foraging tactic through the Sarasota populationâ€™s social network and to evaluate the traits of individual dolphins that could play a disproportionate role in facilitating the diffusion of such risky behaviors. By developing a set of models based on the network-based diffusion analysis framework to the +50 years of individualized foraging and social association data, we aim to quantify how much, if any, of the diffusion of begging behavior is due to individual dolphins learning it by themselves (individual learning), and how much is due to individuals socially learning from their peers, mothers, or other relatives. This effort can provide quantitative evidence for social learning of this behavior, identify the pathways of transmission (individual, horizontal, oblique, and vertical social learning) and test whether individual (e.g. sex, age) or dyadic covariates (home-range overlap, relatedness) influence learning rates.
