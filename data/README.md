### Descriptions of data

- `centroid_list.RData`: This is a list of each individual's centroid coordinates according to their kernel density estimated home range.
- `cv_years.RData`: This is a list of each study period's 1000 permutated coefficient of variation values.
- `el_years.RData`: This is a list of the edge weights between each pair of individuals in each study period.
- `gbi.RData`: This is a list of the group-by-individual matrices in each study period.
- `HI_list.RData`: This is a list of each individual's engagment in each human-centric foraging tactic between each study period.
- `ig.RData`: This is a list of the 'igraph' package network code of each study period.
- `ILV_dem.csv`: This is a corrected dataframe of each individual's demographics.
- `ILV_mat.RData`: This is a list that contains the similarity matrices of sex and age between pairs of individuals.
- `kernel.RData`: This is a list of the kernel density estimates of each individual in each study period.
- `kinship_matrix.RData`: This is matrix of the genetic relatedness between each pair of individual.
- `kov.RDS`: This is a list of the home range overlap between each pair of individuals in each study period.
